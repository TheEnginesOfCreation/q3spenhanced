# q3spenhanced
Enhance Quake III Arena single player mode to include Free For All, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag gametypes.

# building
After checking out, code can be compiled to qvm by running buildall.bat in the code folder.
To build cgame, game or q3_ui projects individually, use the .bat files of the same names in their respective folders.
QVM files will be writting to \quake3\baseq3\vm folder.

# changes so far
- Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag modes possible in single player mode.
- Tracking Capture, Assist and Defense awards in single player mode.
- Single Player Level select UI slightly changed to allow display of new awards.
